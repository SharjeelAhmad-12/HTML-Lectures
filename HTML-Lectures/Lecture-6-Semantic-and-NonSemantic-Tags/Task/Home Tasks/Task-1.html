            <h2>Chapter 1: Forces</h2>
            <p>In this chapter, we will explore the concept of force, how it affects the motion of objects, and the different types of forces that exist.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Force is a push or pull on an object.</li>
                <li>There are different types of forces: contact forces and non-contact forces.</li>
                <li>Newton's 3 laws of motion describe the relationship between force and motion.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Force</dt>
                <dd>A push or pull on an object that can cause it to move or change its velocity.</dd>
                
                <dt>Contact Force</dt>
                <dd>A force that requires two objects to be in physical contact.</dd>
            </dl>

        <!-- Chapter 2: Motion -->
        <section id="motion">
            <h2>Chapter 2: Motion</h2>
            <p>This chapter focuses on the various aspects of motion, including velocity, acceleration, and the relationships between these quantities.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Motion refers to the change in position of an object over time.</li>
                <li>Velocity is the speed of an object in a given direction.</li>
                <li>Acceleration occurs when there is a change in velocity over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Chapter 3: Energy -->
        <section id="energy">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Energy</h2>
            <p>In this chapter, we will explore the various forms of energy and how they are transferred between systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy is the capacity to do work.</li>
                <li>There are various forms of energy: kinetic, potential, thermal, and chemical.</li>
                <li>The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.</li>
            </ul>

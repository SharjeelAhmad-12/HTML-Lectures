# HTML Formatting Tags

HTML provides several tags that are used to format text. These tags are important to display content in a visually appealing way. Below is a list of commonly used formatting tags along with brief explanations:


1. `<b>` - Bold Text
   The `<b>` tag is used to make the text bold. It is a physical style, meaning it affects the appearance of the text but doesn't add semantic meaning.

   `Example:`

   `<b>`This is bold text.`</b>`



2. ` <i> `- Italic Text
   The `<i>` tag is used to italicize text. Like `<b>`, it is a physical style and does not add semantic meaning.
   
    `Example:`

    `<i>`This is italic text.`</i>`

   
3. `<u>` - Underlined Text
   The `<u>` tag is used to underline the text.
   
   `Example:`

   `<u>`This text is underlined.`</u>`
   
4. `<strong>` - Strong Importance
   The `<strong>` tag is used to indicate that the text is of strong importance. It typically renders as bold.
   
   `Example:`

   `<strong>`This text is important.`</strong>`
   
5. `<em>` - Emphasized Text
   The `<em>` tag is used to emphasize text. By default, this renders the text in italics.
   
   `Example:`

   `<em>`This text is emphasized.`</em>`
   
6. `<mark>` - Marked Text
   The `<mark>` tag highlights text, usually rendering it with a yellow background.

   The `<small>` tag is used to reduce the size of the text.
   
   ` Example:`

   `<small>`This is smaller text.`</small>`

8. `<del>` - Deleted Text
   The `<del>` tag indicates that the text has been deleted. It is usually rendered with a strikethrough.
   
   `Example:`

   `<del>`This text is deleted.`</del>`
   
9. `<ins>` - Inserted Text
   The `<ins>` tag is used to indicate that the text has been inserted. It is typically rendered with an underline.
   
   `Example:`

10. `<sub>` - Subscript Text
    The `<sub>` tag is used to display text as subscript, which is often used in mathematical or scientific notations.
    
    `Example:`
    
    H`<sub>`2`</sub>`O
    
11. `<sup>` - Superscript Text
    The `<sup>` tag is used to display text as superscript, typically used for footnotes or exponents.
    
    `Example:`

    The `<code>` tag is used to define a piece of computer code. It usually renders the text in a monospaced font.
    
    `Example:`

    `<code>`console.log('Hello, world!');`</code>`

13. `<pre> `- Preformatted Text
    The `<pre>` tag is used for preformatted text. It retains both spaces and line breaks.
    
    `Example:`

    `<pre>`This is preformatted text. Line breaks and spaces are preserved.
    `</pre>`
    
14. `<blockquote>` - Block Quote
    The `<blockquote>` tag is used to define a block of text that is a quotation from another source.
    
    `Example:`

    `<blockquote>`This is a quoted text fromsomeone`</blockquote>`
    
15. `<cite> `- Citation
    The `<cite>` tag is used to reference the title of a creative work, such as a book, article, or website.
    
    `Example:`

    `<cite>`Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone`<cite>`
    
16. `<q>` - Short Quotation
    The `<q>` tag is used for short inline quotations. It usually renders with quotation marks around the text.
    
    `Example:`

17. `<abbr>` - Abbreviation
    The `<abbr>` tag is used to define an abbreviation or acronym. It often includes the `title` attribute to provide a full form or meaning.

    `Example:`

    `Example`

    `<big>`This text is big.`</big>`

22. `<br>` - Line Break

     The `<br>` tag is used to insert a line break within text, creating a new line without starting a new paragraph.
    
    `Example`

    `<p>`This is the first line.`<br>`This is the second line.`</p>`

23. `<hr>` - Horizontal Rule

    The `<hr>` tag is used to create a horizontal line, typically used to separate sections or topics on a page.
